This repository contains a structured Markdown mind map of the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) policy. The map outlines how cardholder data (CHD) should be secured, accessed, monitored, and maintained to meet PCI compliance requirements.

## 📂 File Included

- [`PCI_DSS_Mind_Map.md`](./PCI_DSS_Mind_Map.md): A hierarchical, well-organized breakdown of PCI DSS domains, including:
  - Cardholder data handling standards
  - Access control requirements
  - Secure development and SDLC practices
  - Logging and alerting mechanisms
  - Physical security and network configuration
  - Key management and cryptography
  - Vulnerability management and incident response

## 🎯 Purpose

This resource is designed for:
- **Security teams** and **auditors** preparing for PCI DSS assessments
- **Developers** building or maintaining PCI-compliant systems
- **IT and GRC professionals** managing cardholder data environments
- Anyone seeking a high-level visualization of PCI policy requirements

## 📈 Visual Mapping

The Markdown format is compatible with most mind-mapping tools (e.g., **XMind**, **Obsidian**, **Markmap**, etc.). You can convert it to `.xmind` or visualize it using online Markdown mind map tools.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open [`PCI_DSS_Mind_Map.md`](./PCI_DSS_Mind_Map.md) in any Markdown viewer or mind map-compatible tool
2. Use it for planning, gap assessments, policy drafting, and internal security reviews
3. Update sections as your PCI compliance posture evolves
